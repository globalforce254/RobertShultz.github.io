        <p>Hello everyone, My name is Robert Shultz and I am majoring in CIS with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I enjoy traveling, food, and spending time with family and friends. I am a veteran and served in the United States Navy and now I am on a new path to find out what is next for me. I love the excitment of the future and enjoying what life offers. My favorite movie is Glory Road, and if you are interested in it, you can watch it for free on Disney Plus. Thank you for reading and I hope everyone has a great year!</p>
